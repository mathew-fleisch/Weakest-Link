          <li>I understand that the name and address on the tax form (<a href="../materials/admin/bh-registration_W9.pdf" target="_blank">W9</a>/<a href="../materials/admin/bh-registration_W8.pdf" target="_blank">W8</a>), which must match the beneficiary listed on the wire transfer, is where the payment will be sent.</li>
          <li>I understand that if I fail to inform Black Hat of any changes to my address or wire information as provided to them by July 20 that it may result in a delay of up to 45 days in my receiving payment from the date that I inform Black Hat of my change of address. I understand a change of address must be accompanied by an updated tax form.</li>
          <li>I will reimburse Black Hat for airfare should Black Hat purchase non-refundable airfare on my behalf and I am unable to attend for any reason.</li>
          <li>I agree to not disparage the Black Hat brand for the duration of this contract (date of Letter of Acceptance to date of payment of honorarium). Any disparaging comments will result in forfeiture of payment including the honorarium and reimbursement for travel.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have read the above and understand and agree to the terms as detailed in the Agreement to Terms of Speaking Remuneration.</p>
