            <h2>Overview</h2>	
		<p>It is day 1. You are charged with securing your company. You have limited resources, management that wants to see progress and a very complex problem to solve. Just where do you begin?</p>
		<p>Whether you are starting from scratch, working within an existing framework, or investigating what an Information Security program could mean for your company, creating a comprehensive Information Security program can be a daunting task.</p>
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
			<li>How do you break down an organization into meaningful, and manageable, pieces?</li>
			<li>Where do you concentrate your efforts and limited resources?</li>
			<li>How do you drill down into the detail without leaving gaps elsewhere?</li>
			<li>How do you develop audits that are relevant and provide meaningful information?</li>
			<li>Which of the thousands of policies, guidelines, procedures, standards and controls do you actually need and how do you get the employees to accept and follow them?</li>
			<li>How do you decide which countermeasures are actually relevant to your needs and how do you ensure that they mesh together?</li>
			<li>How do you manage everything once it is implemented?</li>
			<li>And, perhaps most importantly, how do you get the business to support all of your efforts and keep that support for ongoing and future initiatives?</li>
