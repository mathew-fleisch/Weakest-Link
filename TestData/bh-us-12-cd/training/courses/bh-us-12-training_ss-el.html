           <p><strong class="us11Green">NOTE:</strong> You may register for this class together with <a href="bh-us-12-training_ss-el-bb.html">The Exploit Laboratory: Black Belt</a> as a 4 day course.</p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
					
		<p>Have you ever found yourself staring at a vulnerability advisory with some proof-of-concept snippets and wished the author had rather attached a working exploit with it? Have you wished you could analyze vulnerabilities and write your own exploits for them? Have you wanted to debug and exploit custom built applications and binaries? The Exploit Laboratory, now in its fifth year, is an intense hands-on class for those wishing to dive into vulnerability analysis and exploit writing. The Exploit Laboratory starts off with a basic insight into system architecture, process execution, operating systems and error conditions. The class then quickly accelerates to analyzing vulnerabilities with debuggers, reproducing reliable error conditions and writing working exploits for the same. The Exploit Laboratory features popular third party applications and products as candidates for vulnerability analysis and exploitation, rather than building up on carefully simulated lab exercises. Most of the class time is spent working on lab exercises and examples. Lab examples and exercises used in this class cover both the Unix (Linux) and Microsoft Windows platforms, illustrating various error conditions such as stack overflows, heap overflows and memory overwrites. The latter part of the class focuses on topics such as browser exploitation, PDF exploitation and Mac OS X exploitation. All thisâ€”delivered in a down-to-earth, learn-by-example methodology, by trainers who have been teaching advanced topics in computer security for over 10 years. This class is updated from the 2009 edition, featuring revised content on heap overflows, abusing exception handlers and more hands-on examples based on recent vulnerabilities. This class does NOT require knowledge of assembly language. A few concepts and a sharp mind is all you need.</p>
		
		<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
		
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		    <li>Understanding Error Conditions</li>

		    <li>Debugging applications and sharpening debugging skills, using GDB and WinDBG</li>
		    <li>Putting together an exploit</li>
		    <li>Shellcode - various types of shellcode and functionality</li>
		    <li>Crafting the attack vector and payload</li>
		    <li>Making the exploit work reliably</li>
		    <li>Stack overflows on Linux and Windows</li>
		    <li>Return to stack vs. Return through registers</li>

Saumil also provides information security consulting services to Net-Square clients, specializing in ethical hacking and security architecture. He holds a designation of Certified Information Systems Security Professional. Saumil has had more than nine years experience with system administration, network architecture, integrating heterogeneous platforms, and information security and has performed numerous ethical hacking exercises for many significant companies in the IT area. Saumil is a regular speaker at security conferences such as Black Hat, RSA, etc.</p>
		
		<p>Previously, Saumil was the Director of Indian operations for Foundstone Inc, where he was instrumental in developing their web application security assessment methodology, the web assessment component of FoundScan - Foundstone's Managed Security Services software and was instrumental in pioneering Foundstone's </p>
		
		<p>Prior to joining Foundstone, Saumil was a senior consultant with Ernst &amp; Young, where he was responsible for the company's ethical hacking and security architecture solutions. Saumil has also worked at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, as a research assistant and is currently a visiting faculty member there.</p>

		<p><strong>S.K. Chong</strong> (CISSP) is a security consultant from SCAN Associates. His job allows him to play with all kinds of hacking tools and exploits in his penetration testing. Most often, he needs to modify and/or enhance these tools before it can be used for legal penetration testing for banks, ISPs government agencies, etc. If exploit code is not available, his understanding of security advisories, exploitation and buffer overflow concepts have allowed him to create exploit code on the fly. These experiences have helped him discover other similar yet new bugs. SK has authored security whitepapers on SQL Injection, Buffer overflows, Shellcode and Windows Kernel research, including one of which was published in Phrack E-zine #62. His research has been presented in many security conferences around the world like Black Hat, XCon, HITBSecConf, etc.</p>
