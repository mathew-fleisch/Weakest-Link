            <h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Finally! This is the course on Information Security you've been searching for! "Real World Security: Attack, Defend, & Repel" is a complete 2 day simulation that will not only test your existing skills, but provide you with a real life scenario where you can learn valuable new skills. Whether you work in incident response, active detection and defense, security evaluations, or penetration testing; this course will give you that incredibly rare opportunity to put it all to the test, and learn BOTH sides of the house. Team Fortress 2 meets hacker training.</p>

<p>"Real World Security: Attack, Defend, & Repel" attempts to challenge and motivate information security professionals to hone the knowledge and skills they already have, and also to learn "the other side", as well. The class will be split into two halves, attackers and defenders. On the second day, those two teams will trade sides, allowing every student the opportunity to learn both sides and work with all instructors.</p>

<img src="../../images/speakers/PEAK-bots1.png" />
		
		
		<p>The scenarios and exercises are instructor chosen and lead, and will escalate in tiers of difficulty as the course progresses. What may begin as a simple defense will evolve into something more complicated, based on the scenario. This exercise will contain elements of the following:</p>	
				
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		    <li>Active Defense Techniques</li>
		    <li>Active Incident Response</li>
		    <li>Intrusion Detection/Prevention</li>
		    <li>Log Analysis</li>
		    <li>Reverse Engineering</li>
		    <li>Vulnerability Identification/scanning</li>
		    <li>Penetration Testing</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>As is true in the real world, you'll be forced to do your "job" under the restrictions of your company "Boss".  Your boss will assign you a specific goal that you need to achieve by the end of the 4th scenario. You'll gather more information about the target, and your own company, as you move through each scenario. In some cases, you may be lucky enough to find new tools to add to your arsenal as you work through each scenario.</p>
								
		                        
								
		<h2>Student Requirements</h2>
		
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		    <li>Desire to learn, participate, and have fun</li>
		    <li>Knowledge of Windows or Linux, networking, and at least basic hacking (scans, log analysis, net commands, etc)</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>What to Bring</h2>
		
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		    <li>Bring a laptop with at least 2 GB RAM (preferably 4 GB)</li>
		    <li>Use whatever OS you're comfortable with, but please bring Vmplayer, Vmware workstation, or Vmware Fusion.  We will provide other virtual machines for use in the class, but you're welcome to use your own custom platform.</li>
		    <li>Your laptop must be capable of communicating on a network.</li>
		    <li>Bring an external drive if you want copies of the virtual machines provided in class.</li>
		    <li>Expect to spend at least 9 hours in class each day.</li>
		</ul>
		
	
		<h2>What you get</h2>
		<p>In addition to the high quality training, each student will also receive a brand new, full size laptop for use in the course, to take notes, and as a take away. Students must remain in the course for the full duration to receive the laptop.</p>
