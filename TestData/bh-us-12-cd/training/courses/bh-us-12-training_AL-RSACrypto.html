		<h3>Overview:</h3>
		
		<p>Every security professional knows the basics of encryption, but do they really know how 
		it works? The fact is that we often look at cryptographic primitives as mystical black 
		boxes. This is sometimes advantageous but can also lead to misunderstandings and 
		mistakes. For example, a deep understanding of how cryptosystems are built and 
		broken makes it clear why it is so important to use only standardized schemes. Similarly, 
		in order to properly determine what key lengths must be used for public-key encryption, 
		digital signatures, and key exchange, we need to know what the best algorithms are for 
		attacking these schemes and how they work. Furthermore, we need to look at the 
		history and development of these attacks in order to make safe predictions for the 
		coming decade. Finally, many cryptosystems are broken due to implementations that 
		seem robust but actually leave the door wide open to attack. Without an understanding 
		of these often surprising and elegant attacks, it is almost impossible to implement 
		crypto properly. </p>
		
		<p>In this one-day intensive course, we will focus on the RSA cryptosystem in great depth. 
		Participants will gain a thorough understanding of how the RSA cryptosystem works and 
		the main algorithmic issues that arise when implementing it. In addition, we will study 
		attacks on RSA with a focus on the lessons learned from these attacks. We conclude 
		with a session on choosing key-lengths for RSA-based cryptosystems, based on a 
		comprehensive understanding of the issues involved. </p>
		
		<p>In addition to frontal lectures, this one-day course includes interactive exercise sessions 
		in order to ensure a good understanding of the material studied. </p>
		
		<p>This course is essential to developers who need to understand cryptographic primitives 
		in depth in order to properly use them and also to security professionals who need to 
		make truly informed decisions about what products to use and why. </p>	
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this is a single day course (Sunday only).</em></p>
								
		                        
		<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
		
		<p>This course will assume mathematical maturity, but no specific mathematical 
		knowledge. For example, it is not assumed that the students know modular arithmetic 
		and number theory, but it is assumed that if explained, they will catch on fairly quickly. 
		In addition, participants should be familiar and comfortable with very basic probability, 
		with the notions of algorithms and with basic notions of computer science. </p>
								
		
		<h3>What to bring:</h3>
		<p>Students should bring paper, pens, and calculators. Laptops are helpful, but not required.</p>
		
										 
		<h3>Trainer:</h3>
		<p><strong>Andrew (Yehuda) Lindell</strong> is an Associate Professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. 
		Andrew attained a Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2002 and spent two 
		years at the IBM T.J. Watson research lab as a Postdoctoral fellow in the cryptography 
		research group. Andrew has carried out extensive research in cryptography, and has 
		published more than 60 conference and journal publications, as well as an 
		undergraduate textbook on cryptography and a book detailing secure protocols. Andrew 
		has presented at numerous international conferences, workshops and university 
		seminars, and has served on program committees for top international conferences in 
		cryptography. In addition to Andrew's notable academic work, he has significant 
		industry experience and has worked on the cryptographic and security issues that arise 
		in the design and construction of authentication schemes, smartcard applications, 
		software protection schemes and more. </p>
