            <h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Cadet Edition is an introductory course for technical people with no previous experience in the world of hacking. The course will present you with background information, technical skills and basic concepts required to get you going. This includes some coding and scripting, networking and Internet technologies, basic methodologies, essential thinking skills, tools and current hacking techniques.</p>

<p>The core essentials that the course delivers will enable you to successfully embark on more current intermediate level hacking courses.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		  <li>An introduction to hacker thinking, asking the right question and understanding the problem</li>
		  <li>Method-based hacking at a layered approach that teaches the building blocks to any security assessment.     Essential technologies when analysing various frameworks from a hacker perspective</li>
		  <li> Basic coding for hackers, why scripting can go a long way</li>
		  <li> An introduction into current hacking tools and techniques, which demonstrate how basic vulnerabilities, could lead to full system compromise</li>
		  <li> Real-world and capture-the-flag exercises that will challenge the knowledge you learn during the course of the HBN series</li>
		</ul>
					
		<h2>Context</h2>
		
		<p>Cadet is the introductory course to the Hacking By Numbers series. It's aimed at beginners and serves to prepare students for the Bootcamp Edition. Cadet and Bootcamp Edition can be taken back-to-back aka "HBN Extended". There is a small amount of overlap between the courses but they have been carefully designed to provide a congruent learning curve experience.  The course aims to educate any student in methods followed which enable attackers to primarily build an attack surface of outlined real-world targets, and the necessary techniques and mind-set required to compromise these platforms. Learning these "tools of the trade" will enhance your capability to understand how hackers manage to compromise organisations when best practice has not been applied.  The course has been updated to accommodate the latest technologies and trends.</p>
        
<p>Information security officers, system and network administrators, security consultants, government agencies and other nice people will all benefit from the valuable insights provided by this class.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Cadet Edition is designed for technical people who have no skill or experience in hacking. The course remains technical however, and students are expected to have a solid practical grasp of computer operating systems, networks and databases. SensePost will provide fully configured laptop computers as well as CDs with all the tools and materials used in the course.</p>
