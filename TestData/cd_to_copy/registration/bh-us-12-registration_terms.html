			<ul class="purple-bullet">
				<li>receive a refund your monies in full should you choose to cancel your training - you will not be assessed an administrative fee.</li>
				<li>move to another class if there is space in the class. You should complete the form that was sent to you via email and return it as directed on the form. </li>
				<li>Please note that if the newly selected course is more expensive then you must pay the difference. If the newly selected course is less expensive, you will be given a refund for the difference in the original payment instrument.</li>
			</ul>
				
			
			<p><em>You will not receive a refund for the entire conference should you choose to cancel your entire registration. You will only receive a refund for the cancelled class.
