				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>How do you conduct a comprehensive and successful penetration test?  What services, methodologies, timeframe and skillsets are necessary for effective execution? There are often no easy answers to these questions for testers whose job it is to provide quality services in constrained environments and must often justify the resources they need to execute successful engagements. The purpose of this course is to assist participants in adapting to these challenging environments by conducting penetration tests that are consistent, repeatable and measurable. While such assessments cannot be designed to cover every possible attack vector, their goal should be to assess the business purpose and likely intrusion points into the customer's network; provide customers with valuable insight into actual risks and business impacts of network intrusions; all while working under the real-world constraints of with limited resources, team members of unknown skillset and restricted engagement timeframes.  </p>

<p>In this course, we're going to dive into how to use methodologies, techniques and tools to provide comprehensive assessments as efficiently as possible. The only way to learn how to effectively conduct penetration tests is to practice. As such, participants will spend the majority of the course in practical lab scenarios, overcoming the real obstacles faced in today's enterprise environments and learning to get the most power out of the tools available. While tools don't make the tester, having the right tools for the job can often make or break the assessment. To illustrate the power of this point, we have partnered with Strategic Cyber, LLC, founded by Raphael Mudge (the creator of Armitage) to provide participants with their new advanced penetration testing suite, Cobalt Strike (<a href="http://www.advancedpentest.com/">http://www.advancedpentest.com/</a>). Cobalt Strike is all about enabling teams to conduct penetration tests as efficiently and effectively as possible and participants will be using it throughout the course to overcome advanced obstacles and emulate modern attacks. In addition, participant will be provided a 30-day license to evaluate Cobalt Strike out in their environments.</p>

<p>This course is fast paced with numerous challenging labs, tools, technologies and methodologies. Much like in real environments, participants will be pressed for time and must overcome the obstacles that can make every-day testing difficult. Just as testers must do in real world engagements, participants will have to rely on their skills, intuition and tools to succeed. Most importantly, this course is designed for participants to walk away with the ability to actually conduct thorough, operationally focused network penetration tests.  
</p>
		
				<h2>Who should attend</h2>
				<p>The course is also meant to provide a broad technical overview of many technologies with a heavy practical scenario-based lab focus. Labs will be very technically difficult and designed to emulate testing environments.</p>

<p>Participants should have two to three years of information security experience with the ability to conduct common penetration testing activities without assistance. This includes conducting information gathering and network enumeration activities, quickly launch exploits with a chosen exploit framework, conducting privilege escalation activities and post-exploitation information gathering and network foothold activities.</p>
