            <h2>Overview</h2>
									
		<p>Reality, Theory and Practice! This course is the "How did they do that?" of modern hacking attacks. From start to finish we will lead you through the full compromise of a company's IT systems, explaining the tools and technologies, but especially the thinking, strategies and the methodologies for every step along the way. "Hacking By Numbers â€“ Bootcamp Edition" will give you a complete and practical window into the methods and thinking of hackers.</p>
		
		<strong>Topics include:</strong>
		<ul class="purple-bullet">
		  <li> A quick review of key concepts and technologies</li>
		  <li> A review of Internet Reconnaissance</li>
		  <li> A review of fingerprint - portscanning, OS and service identification</li>
		  <li> Vulnerability Discovery</li>
		  <li> Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities</li>
		  <li> Finding and Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Web Applications</li>
		  <li> Real-world exercises and capture-the-flag</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>SensePost will provide fully configured laptop computers as well as CDs with all the tools and materials used in the course. Students need to ensure they have the necessary level of skill. No hacking experience is required for this course, but a solid technical grounding is an absolute must. Students are expected to be versed in basic programming or scripting, networking and Internet technologies, 'nix and Windows operating systems, basic SQL and database technologies. No advanced skills are required, but students without a good, practical knowledge of these areas will fall behind in this fast-paced class. Students without the requisite technical skills are encouraged to consider 'Cadet Edition'. Cadet and Bootcamp Edition can be taken back-to-back.</p>
		  
		
		<h2>Context</h2>
		
		<p>'Bootcamp' is SensePost's 'introduction to hacking' course. It is strongly method based and emphasizes structure, approach and thinking over tools and tricks. The course is popular with beginners, who gain their first view into the world of hacking, and experts, who appreciate the sound, structured approach.</p>

<p>Cadet and Bootcamp Edition can be taken back-to-back. There is a small amount of overlap between the courses but they have been carefully designed to provide a congruent learning experience.</p>

<p>Students who have mastered the Bootcamp Edition will be perfectly prepared to move on the 'BlackOps' Edition to sharpen their skills in real hacking scenarios.</p>
		 
		
		<h2>Who should attend</h2>
		
		<p>Information security officers, system and network administrators, security consultants, government agencies and other nice people will all benefit from the valuable insights provided by this class.</p>
		
		
		<h2>What to bring</h2>
		
		<p>Just Yourself. All necessary equipment will be provided, including pre-configured laptops, tools and utilities.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Free additional tools workshop</h2>
		
		<p>After the first day of the course SensePost offers a free additional workshop on using their suite of hacking tools, including Wikto, Aura, Suru, Crowbar, BidiBLAH and others, copies of which will be distributed to all students. The tools workshop is open to all attendees of any SensePost course and run in the evening after training. Precise times and locations will be announced during the training courses.</p>
									
		
		<h2>Course Length</h2> 
		
		<p>Two days. All course materials, lunch and two coffee breaks will be provided. A Certificate of Completion will be offered.</p>
