            <h2>Overview</h2>
		
													
		
		<p><strong>Why Do We Teach This Class?</strong></p>
					
						
							
		<p>Mission-critical data, secrets and other company information transmitted into the air cause hackers everywhere to rejoice!</p>
		
		<p>Wireless networks bring unique challenges to those tasked with their defense. How confident are you that your wireless infrastructure can withstand the latest attacks by the world's cleverest hackers? Do vendors' claims tell the whole story? Where is your Achilles heel? Beyond the authorized wireless infrastructure you know exists in your organization, what about the wireless networks that aren't supposed to be there? Do you know when an onsite vendor or consulting company tucked away in a forgotten conference room plugs in their mobile access point?</p>
		
		<p>What about that temporary access point in a QA lab that is still there months later? What about the wireless clients themselves? Laptops, smart phones, printers, VoIP phones, HVAC systems, and even the remote controls in your executive board rooms are all using wireless technologies. Organizations may have a secured wireless infrastructure but find themselves in trouble when these untamed devices are coaxed into connecting to a clever hackers fake access point. Untamed devices that are jacked into your companies ethernet seeking essids like "linksys" are creating a bridge for attackers to get onto your internal network.</p>
		
		<p>Foundstone's internationally renowned, "Ultimate Hacking: Hands On" series goes wireless to help you see your wireless networks the way hackers see them. Learn the tools, techniques and methods attackers use against you in order to develop an effective defense against their increasingly sophisticated onslaught. Knowledge is power and you do not want the hackers to know more about your wireless networks than you doâ€¦</p>
		
		
		<h2>What Will You Learn</h2>
		
		
		<p>Security vulnerabilities are an unfortunate, but unavoidable, part of today's computing systems. If exploited by internal or external users, these weaknesses can be catastrophic to your organization. Foundstone teaches step-by-step procedures for executing Internet, intranet, and host-level security reviews. This course is the definitive training for learning how to perform "tiger team" and attack and penetration assessments.</p>
		
		<p>Foundstone instructors cover all the bases, presenting manual and scripted security-review techniques that go far beyond what automated analysis tools can do. You return to your organization with valuable knowledge, experience, and the ability to put your new skills into practice.</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h2>Who Teaches This Class</h2>
		
		<p>Based out of Foundstone's New York office, Brad is a senior security
		consultant focusing on internal/external penetration testing, web
		application penetration testing, firewall configuration reviews, network
		architecture reviews, and 802.11 wireless assessments. Brad is not only
		the network penetration testing service line lead, but has developed
		courseware and served as an instructor for Foundstone's "Ultimate
		Hacking" series classes.</p>
		
		<p>Brad is a contributing author to the sixth edition of Hacking Exposed
		and has authored articles and white papers such as 802.11 Attacks,
		Defeating the iPhone Passcode and Java Basics - Extracting Decompiling,
		Recompiling, and Signing. He has developed wireless hacking tools such
		as "FreeRADIUS-WPE", various Metasploit modules, multiple internal
		Foundstone testing tools, and is currently assisting in developing two
		Foundstone free tools which will be released later this year. Finally
		Brad is involved in security research and is an active member of
		Foundstone internal vulnerability discovery team which focuses on
		finding application flaws in popular software. Brad is responsible for
		discovering a number of CVE's and has developed publically released
		exploit code to demonstrate impact.</p>
