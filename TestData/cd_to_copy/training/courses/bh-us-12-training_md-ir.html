            <h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Mandiant has raised the bar of effective detection, response, and remediation through their Incident Response (IR) coursework.  This two-day Special Edition class teaches the fundamental and cutting edge data collection and analysis techniques information security professionals need to investigate increasingly complex intrusion scenarios.  The course contains case studies and hands-on lab exercises tailored to the latest attack scenarios identified by Mandiant's investigations into the compromise of public and private sector organizations.  Attendees will gain experience in the following topic areas.</p>

		<br />
        
        <p>These topics will help prepare you for some of the most common questions and challenges facing an incident responder, such as:</p>
        <ul class="purple-bullet">
		<li>How do you fully "scope" an incident?</li>
		<li>What is the best way to conduct rapid triage on a system to determine if it is compromised?</li>
		<li>What types of evidence result from common initial attack vectors such as spear-phishing or web application exploits?</li>
		<li>How do attackers establish persistence on a system?</li>
		<li>What are the tell-tale signs of attacker lateral movement and privilege escalation in a compromised environment?</li>
		<li>How can attackers manipulate evidence, and how can you detect and defeat such techniques?</li>
        </ul>
        
		<p>The class is structured to include exercises, tools, and sample evidence based on real-world cases throughout the material – we strive to minimize lecture time and maximize hands-on learning.</p>
