Weakest-Link
============

HTML crawler to test links and report status.

To Do:

	~ Add .php, .htm and .js files instead of just .html files
	
	~ Turn script into command line application 
	
	~ Create web interface to generate command
	
	~ Allow user to ommit correct links (only show bad links)
	
	~ Allow user to skip line number detail view (only show external link results)
	
	~ After script finishes, automatically open report in excel or open office or a normal text editor
